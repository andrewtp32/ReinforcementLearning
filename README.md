# ReinforcementLearning
Created this repository to publicize all of my notes, tutorials, and personal projects that are related to Reinforcement Learning. Followed this github project:
https://github.com/nicknochnack/ReinforcementLearningCourse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mut_u40Sqz4&list=PLgNJO2hghbmid6heTu2Ar68CzJ344nUHy&index=1

`main_course.py` is where most of my notetaking takes place. Project folders are labeled somewhat obviously.
